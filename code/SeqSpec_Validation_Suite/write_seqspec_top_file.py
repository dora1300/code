@Title:             write_seqspec_top_file.py
@Name:              Mando A Ramirez

@Description:       This script generates a topology file for a sequence specific force field
simulation of coiled-coils. Hence the abbreviation "ssff" at the start of the code.

This is not the only code you can or should run to generate the things you need. This only 
generates a .top file

@Updates:
20250708            Originally part of stand-alone testing for sequence specific parameters.
Now this is going to be part of an automated workflow for setting up validation simulations for
testing sequence specific parameters.
This will allow the user to specify multiple molecule types as necessary and all the relevant 
copies and .itp files. 
This script should be generalizable for any type of set up that I want, since the protein .itp files
are handled elsewhere.
