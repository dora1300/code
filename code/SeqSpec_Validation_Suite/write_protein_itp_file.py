@Description:       This script generates the BIG KAHUNA -- the ITP file for the individual
protein sequence that I will simulate using the sequence specific interaction terms.

Though this itp shouldn't change much in between interaction parameters, there are many places
for intervention in this ITP should I want to change strength of force constants and assignment
of secondary structure.

AND THAT -- assignment of seconday structure -- is the crux of this code. I have to know something
about which parts of a protein are likely to be helical/coiled-coil and which are not, because I have
to know how to assign the torsional parameters.

This script DOES NOT make predictions about secondary structure. Do that somewhere else. This 
script just takes some prediction and translates that into a GROMACS-ready .itp file.
